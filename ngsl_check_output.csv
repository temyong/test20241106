2. **お願いします (onegaishimasu)**: This is a polite expression used to make requests or ask for favors. It is a verb form, specifically the polite form of ""お願いする"" (onegai suru), meaning ""to request"" or ""to ask.""

- 上 (ue): A noun meaning ""above"" or ""on.""

In this phrase, ""の"" is the only particle, and it functions similarly to a preposition in English by indicating a relationship between ""さまざまな部分"" (various parts) and ""上"" (above/on) or ""中"" (inside/within).

2. **打つ (うつ)** - This is a verb meaning ""to hit"" or ""to strike.""

- ""〜の"" (no) is a possessive particle, similar to ""of"" in English.

- ""を"" (wo) is an object marker particle.
- ""超えて"" (koete) is the te-form of the verb ""超える"" (koeru), which means ""to exceed"" or ""to go beyond.""

In Japanese, prepositions as they exist in English don't have a direct equivalent. Instead, Japanese uses particles and verb forms to convey similar relationships. The phrase ""〜の範囲を超えて"" functions more like a verbal phrase or clause rather than a standalone preposition. It describes an action or state of going beyond a certain scope or range.",

2. ひと揃い (ひとそろい) - This is a noun meaning ""a set"" or ""a suit.""
3. の - This is a possessive particle used to connect nouns, similar to ""of"" or the possessive ""'s"" in English.

When combined, ""愛する人"" (aisuru hito) functions as a noun phrase meaning ""loved one"" or ""person who is loved."" In this context, ""人"" is the noun, and ""愛する"" acts as a modifier for the noun. Therefore, the entire phrase functions as a noun phrase. However, ""愛する"" on its own is not in the form of a noun; it is a verb.",

Together, ""責任のある"" can be translated as ""having responsibility"" or ""responsible,"" but it is not a standalone adjective. Instead, it modifies a noun, similar to how relative clauses work in English. 

In Japanese, adjectives typically end in ""い"" (i-adjectives) or ""な"" (na-adjectives) when they directly modify nouns. ""責任のある"" does not fit this pattern, as it uses the structure of a noun (""責任"") followed by ""のある"" to describe another noun.",

2. **責任のある (せきにんのある)**: This phrase means ""responsible"" or ""having responsibility."" Here, '責任' (せきにん) means ""responsibility,"" and 'のある' is a construction that can be used to form an adjectival phrase. While '責任のある' functions adjectivally to describe a noun, it is not a standalone adjective like '大きい' (big) or '小さい' (small). Instead, it is a noun ('責任') followed by 'のある,' which turns it into a phrase that can describe a noun.

3. **を扱った (をあつかった)** - This is a verb phrase. ""を"" is the object marker, and ""扱った"" is the past tense of the verb ""扱う"" (あつかう), meaning ""to handle"" or ""to deal with.""

In this phrase, '恋愛の' functions adjectivally to describe something related to romance, but it is not an adjective by itself; it is a noun modified by the possessive particle 'の.' The verb phrase 'を扱った' is not an adjective either.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **有名な (yūmei na)** - This is an adjective. Specifically, it is a ""na-adjective"" (形容動詞 or けいようどうし), which means it requires the particle ""な"" when modifying a noun.

2. **よく知られた (yoku shirareta)** - This is also functioning as an adjective. It is derived from the verb 知る (shiru, ""to know"") in its passive past form 知られた (shirareta), meaning ""well-known."" In this form, it acts as an adjective to describe a noun.

2. 高尚な (koushou na) - This is an adjective meaning ""noble"" or ""refined."" The ""な"" (na) is a common ending for adjectives in Japanese, specifically for na-adjectives (形容動詞, keiyoudoushi).

1. 所定の大きさの紙 (shotei no ookisa no kami) - This part translates to ""paper of a specified size."" Here, ""紙"" (kami) is a noun meaning ""paper."" The rest are modifiers: ""所定の"" (shotei no) means ""specified,"" and ""大きさの"" (ookisa no) means ""of size.""

2. 1枚 (ichi-mai) - This is a counter used for flat objects like sheets of paper. ""枚"" (mai) is a counter, and ""1"" (ichi) is a numeral. Together, they function as a noun phrase indicating ""one sheet.""

In summary, ""紙"" (kami) and ""1枚"" (ichi-mai) are noun-related, with ""1枚"" functioning as a noun phrase due to the numeral and counter combination. The modifiers ""所定の"" and ""大きさの"" are not nouns; they are adjectival phrases modifying ""紙.""",

- ""の"" (no): A possessive particle that connects the counter to the noun.
- ""紙"" (kami): This means ""paper"" and is a noun.

A more suitable translation for 'row' in the context of seating would be '列' (gyou) or '列' (retsu), but specifically for seating, '列' (retsu) is not typically used.
